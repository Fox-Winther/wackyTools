# wackyTools
Just a few simple tools that i like to make in python while also learning new things about it (and also while borderline overdosing on caffeine)

Tho "liking" doesn't mean "being good at" coding, so a lot of my code may look like it was written by a gorilla on heavy drugs.
And by that i mean: Any help is welcome. Feel free to add your own piece of code wherever you like (otherwise it will be visibly signalized).

also im not a native english speaker so beware
