# wackyTools
Just a few simple tools that i like to make in python while also learning new things about it 

most of them are reeeeeally small projects and might never be touched again after completion

i also plan to port them into a compiling language, that way installing Python wont be needed

## INSTALATION ##

-- as any python script, you must first intall the lastest Python3 before running
