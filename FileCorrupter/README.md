This WackyTool provides a file corrupter script that generates a gibberish code file with the name, extension and size you desire.

Three versions where made: The first two that runs in the terminal; And the third, a GUI made in Tkinter.

# Instructions:
  fileCorrupter.py => run the script via the terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.
  
  fileCorrupterPT.py => same as the original, but in portuguese for my irmãos e irmãs.
  
  fileCorrupterVa2.py => (GUI VERSION) type the values onto the fields and click "CORRUPT!".
